<h1>Multiplayer "Go" Game</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project is a multiplayer implementation of the classic game, "Go". The development process involved collaboration among a team of four to build out
a textual and graphical interface, playable smart-bot mode, multiple game rulesets, and game logic tests.
<br />
<h2>Key Features</h2>

<ul>
        <li><strong>✅ Game Logic</strong> – Collaborated as a team to implement the core game mechanics, adhering to an abstract base class specification while applying software design principles to develop supporting classes.</li>
        <li><strong>✅ Individual Component Development</strong> – Each team member focused on one of four specialized components:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>🎨 <strong>GUI Development</strong> – Built an interactive graphical user interface using the <code>pygame</code> framework.</li>
            <li>🖥️ <strong>TUI Implementation</strong> – Designed a text-based interface, optionally integrating third-party libraries.</li>
            <li>🤖 <strong>Game-Playing Bot</strong> – Researched and implemented an automated bot to play the game using basic AI strategies.</li>
            <li>🛠️ <strong>Quality Assurance (QA)</strong> – Developed comprehensive tests for the game logic using the <code>pytest</code> framework.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
